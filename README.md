# OtherProjects

* Some of the Free Code Camp projects I have done include:
  * a random quote machine https://goo.gl/ohPXmE which is responsive and where I implemented buttons to tweet the quote and share it on Tumblr. I did so by reading the official docs and googling for what I didnâ€™t know;
  * another random quote machine https://goo.gl/Hk6tnn in which it is also possible to automatically search for the author of the quote;
  * a page that displays the current weather https://goo.gl/ErCL9R It consumes data from a public API, and can find the location of the user, show the weather and change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
* I have been to some meetups, such as a Codebar monthly talk, and a hackathon (peacehackLDN 2017: Robots for Peace) in which I built a Twitter bot that sends a random message of peace every hour: https://twitter.com/GiadaPeaceBot
