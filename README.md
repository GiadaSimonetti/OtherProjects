# OtherProjects

### FreeCodeCamp projects:

* a [random quote machine](https://goo.gl/ohPXmE) which is responsive and where I implemented buttons to tweet the quote and share it on Tumblr. I did so by reading the official docs and googling for what I didnâ€™t know;

* [another random quote machine](https://goo.gl/Hk6tnn) in which it is also possible to automatically search for the author of the quote;

* a page that displays the [current weather](https://goo.gl/ErCL9R) It consumes data from a public API, and can find the location of the user, show the weather and change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Udemy projects:

* A Javascript [color game](https://github.com/GiadaSimonetti/Color-game)

* A Javascript/jQuery [Todo-list](https://github.com/GiadaSimonetti/Todo-list)

### Codeschool project:

### peacehackLDN 2017 project:

* I have been to some meetups, such as a Codebar monthly talk, and a hackathon (peacehackLDN 2017: Robots for Peace) in which I built a Twitter bot that sends a random message of peace every hour: https://twitter.com/GiadaPeaceBot .
