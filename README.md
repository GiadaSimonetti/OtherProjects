### FreeCodeCamp projects:

* a page that displays the [current weather](https://goo.gl/ErCL9R) It consumes data from a public API, and can find the location of the user, show the weather and change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

* a [random quote machine](https://goo.gl/ohPXmE) which is responsive and where I implemented buttons to tweet the quote and share it on Tumblr. I did so by reading the official docs and googling for what I didn’t know;

* [another random quote machine](https://goo.gl/Hk6tnn) in which it is also possible to automatically search for the author of the quote;

I have been to some meetups, such as a Codebar monthly talk, and hackathons:

* _**peacehackLDN 2017: Robots for Peace**_ in which I built a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/GiadaPeaceBot) that sends a random message of peace every day.
